# A Site key gives additional protection against a dictionary attack if your
# DB is ever compromised.  With no site key, we store

# If your database were to be compromised you'd be vulnerable to a dictionary
# attack on all your stupid users' passwords.  With a site key, we store
#   DB_password = hash(user_password, DB_user_salt, Code_site_key)
#
# Please note: if you change this, all the passwords will be invalidated, so DO
# keep it someplace secure.  Use the a random value that is moderately long and 
# unpredictable text.

#   passphrase, we can use two techniques [salting and stretching]... that are
#   so simple and obvious that they should be used in every password system.
#   There is really no excuse not to use them." http://tinyurl.com/37lb73

# A modest 10 foldings (the default here) adds 3ms.  This makes brute forcing 10
# times harder, while reducing an app that otherwise serves 100 reqs/s to 78 signin
# reqs/s, an app that does 10reqs/s to 9.7 reqs/s
