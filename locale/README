RubyCampus Language Packs
-------------------------

This directory contains RubyCampus binary MO language files created
from RubyCampus PO template files maintained on the official RubyCampus
translation server at http://translate.rubycampus.org/

The default language for RubyCampus is the English language, under the 
Unicode scheme (UTF8).

RubyCampus packages both fully and partially translated files to help
users and organizations quickly deploy their installation.

While we recommend you preserve all files in this directory you may
safely delete directories for language files you do not intend to use.
